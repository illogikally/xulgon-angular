# Xulgon - A social application
This project is my attempt to clone Facebook with most features, of course, have been simplified. 

# Demo
The app requires an account to be used. You can either create one or use your google account to log in.  
It uses Heroku free dyno so the initial access time would probably be slow (10-20s).
